# Motivation

What if we can connect google colab from our local pc terminal, clone github project, `add/modify/run` **scripts/notebooks** using google colab's free GPU power, build model and then publish code into github, then it will be wonderful. 

This blog aims to achieve this goal.

# Connect google colab with `ssh`

This part is heavily borrowed from this [blog](https://archie9211.github.io/blog/Guide-to-connect-to-google-colab-with-ssh-from-terminal-and-run-jupyter-lab), which I find very useful

**What you need?**

1. `ngrok` Account
2. `ssh public key`

Go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and create an account and copy the `authtoken` only

**Example:**

```sh
./ngrok authtoken <your token>
```

we need only last argument of command from above.

for second option : run `ssh-keygen` and just press enter 3â€“4 times if it asks for anything and then copy the public key.

- run `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` in the terminal

### :dart: Setup Google Colab

Now **open googlecolab**, connect to desired runtime type and execute following commands in notebook cell:

```sh
! wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/archie9211/ae3c8411da88ae8b2a05b0ee1a4fd412/raw/ee1a6e78fc498ad6d4830cd2eb6033839235ea8a/colab-ssh-jupyter.sh
!bash colab-ssh-jupyter.sh

```

When prompt asks, enter the `authtoken` and `ssh public key` respectively. [You already got this from the above 2 steps]

It will print the ssh command to connect to colab instance. e.g

```sh
ssh root@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 16826 # it will be different for your case
```

**Remember:** When opening colab, set it to `gpu` if you want the gpu benefit.

### :computer: Setup local terminal

**Open terminal in your local pc** and run the command you get on colab cell.

You will get a bash shell logged in to colab instance. for jupyterlab, first install following on the terminal :

```sh
pip3 install jupyterlab && apt install tmux
```

Now run `tmux` and run following command in it: (chose port of your choice: $5$ digits random number preferable)

```sh
jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 56789 --no-browser --allow-root
```

Now Jupyter starts running in `http://0.0.0.0:56789/`, but we can't access it as it's running in the google-colab server. We need to `expose` this url to a `public url` which you can access. This can be done using `tunnelling` and `port forwarding`. 

For exposing local/private url to public url we can use some FREE external service as per this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/ca634r/alternatives_to_serveo_for_localhost_tunneling/) post. We are using `http://localhost.run/`

:warning: _**There is a security risk. Whoever gets access to the public url, can access it. Be careful !!**_

**Steps:**

1. `split` tmux screen horizontally by running `ctrl + b` (default tmux activation mode) and `"`
2. Run the below command

- :warning::no_entry: **Old command not working anymore**
  
```py
ssh -R 80:localhost:56789 ssh.localhost.run

# this is giving domain name already in use issue
```

- :new: :ballot_box_with_check:  **Correct command**

```py
ssh -R 80:localhost:56789 $(openssl rand -base64 12)@ssh.localhost.run

# This generates a random string as domain name and creates
# <random_string>@ssh.localhost.run
```



:clipboard: **Note:** Keep the same port number which you used for running jupyter, here it's $56789$

And this will prompt a public url in the terminal. Copy it and run in the browser.

## :rocket: What did you achieve after all these steps?

- SSH to google colab
- Starting jupyterlab
- Same computing resource that google colab is using at the backend. 
- Now create helper scripts and import them in notebook.
- Instead of a single linear notebook, you can create a project folder and modularize your code easily.
- Apply all the `git` benefits and finally push to `github`.
- Can upload files directly into jupyter notebook.

# Setup `codeserver` in Google ColabServer

The best part is yet to come. So far we have decoupled ourselves from the default google colab notebook and have set up jupyter notebook and have exposed the local url to public url. This gives us lots of flexibilities. But it will be good if we can set up a server based IDE. If we can, then we will get the best of $4$ worlds.

- jupyter notebook (module testing)
- google colab's FREE computing power with GPU
- IDE (project management)
- github (versioning)

Now to set up IDE in google colab server, it's pretty simple. We will install and run `code-server` (server version of vscode) in the colab. We can do it as we have got the `ssh tunnelling`. So we can easily install and run the code-server. And then we will expose it's local url (wrt to colab server) to public url like the earlier method.

**Steps**

- Go to the code-server release [page](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases)
- Copy the link of the appropriate binaries
- Using `wget` download it into your google colab's terminal (already connected from the first part)

```py
wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/2.1698/code-server2.1698-vsc1.41.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

- Unzip it
- `cd` into the code-server directory
- run the below script for running the code-server in a specified port

```sh
PASSWORD=1234 ./code-server --port=56790
```

- This will start a code-server instance
- Split screen using `tmux`
- Next expose the local url (port:56790, in this case) to public url using earlier method 

- :warning::no_entry: **Old command not working anymore**
  
```py
ssh -R 80:localhost:56790 ssh.localhost.run

# this is giving domain name already in use issue
```

- :new: :ballot_box_with_check:  **Correct command**

```py
ssh -R 80:localhost:56790 $(openssl rand -base64 12)@ssh.localhost.run

# This generates a random string as domain name and creates
# <random_string>@ssh.localhost.run
```


Combining all together it looks like this:

All this steps may look little advanced at first, but believe me, it gives great flexibility.

- set up `git config`

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

# :warning: Limitations

This comes with usual limitations of google colab

1. The instance will run for 12 hours and after that it will restart
2. After restart, you will loose the codes and uploaded data files

## :bulb: Solution

For the first part no solution


For the second part some possible solution

- Commit and push code to github frequently.
- Connect google drive with colab and all. But I haven't explored that path. So don't know.


:santa: **FIN**
