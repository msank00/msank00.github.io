## **Multi Arm bandit**

The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic problem that well demonstrates the `exploration vs exploitation` dilemma. Imagine you are in a casino facing `multiple slot machines` and each is configured with an `unknown probability` of how likely you can get a `reward` at one play. The question is: **What is the best strategy to achieve highest long-term rewards?**

A naive approach can be that you continue to playing with one machine for many many rounds so as to eventually estimate the “true” reward probability according to the law of large numbers. However, this is quite wasteful and surely does not guarantee the best long-term reward.

## **Bandit Problem**

This tutorial intends to be an introduction to stochastic and adversarial multi-armed bandit algorithms and to survey some of the recent advances. In the multi-armed bandit problem, at each stage, an agent (or decision maker) chooses one action (or arm), and receives a reward from it. The agent aims at maximizing his rewards. Since he does not know the process generating the rewards, he needs to explore (try) the different actions and yet, exploit (concentrate its draws on) the seemingly most rewarding arms.

Let's say the Bandit had $K$ arms and $N$ rounds.

- if $K \lt N$: Small set of actions
- if $K \gt N$: Large set of actions
