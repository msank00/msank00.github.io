# What is Exposure?

Exposure refers to an individual’s `susceptibility to various risks encountered` in daily life. It denotes the individual’s potential for accidents and other losses. Insurance companies evaluate the level of risk an individual faces and use it to calculate insurance premiums. For instance, the more frequently a person drives a car, the higher that individual’s exposure to accidents and other similar problems will be. In some cases, insurance companies refer to their insured entities as exposures too. This is because the policyholders represent risks to the insurance company, since the insurer will need to pay the appropriate benefits to the policyholders if they file a claim.

# What is TotalLoss?

![image](http://cdn.yourarticlelibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/clip_image002_thumb.gif)

In insurance claims, a total loss or write-off is a situation where the lost value, repair cost or salvage cost of a damaged property, exceeds its insured value (the value which the insurer agreed to pay in the contract).
Such a loss may be an `actual total loss` or a `constructive total loss`. Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair.

In a total loss, the insurer must indemnify the assured in full, and ownership of the insured item thereby passes to the insurer under the legal process of "subrogation". Although the policy determines the level at which the loss becomes total rather than partial, nevertheless the assured (and NOT the insurer) has the final say as to whether he wishes to make a partial or total claim. 

**Actual total loss** occurs under these following situations:

- The subject-matter is completely destroyed.
- The goods are so damaged that they cease to be a thing of the kind which were insured.
- The insured is deprived of the subject-matter. 


When a ship is sunk or is completely destroyed by fire, it will be a case of actual total loss. There may be a case when the goods are so damaged that they do not look like goods which were insured e.g. if crockery is reduced to pieces, it is a case of actual total loss.

In another case if the insured is not able to get the things back i.e., if the ship is missing and there is no trace of it, it is also a case of actual total loss. In case of actual total loss the insured is entitled to recover full amount of loss. When the insured has been compensated the title of goods passes on to the insurer. If some amount is received from the sale of damaged goods, the amount will go to the insurer and not to the insured.

## What is Constructive Total Loss:

This occurs when the ship is abandoned for certain reasons. It is not commercially viable to retrieve the ship or cargo. The ship or the cargo is not wholly destroyed but it is not practicable to get it repaired and restore it to its original position. When a ship is badly damaged, and the cost of repairs is expected to be more than the value of the ship, it will be advisable to abandon the ship.

In the same way if the cargo is safe in the abandoned ship but the cost of bringing the cargo to the coast is more than the cost of cargo, then it will be proper to leave the cargo. In the case of constructive total loss, the insured gives a notice of abandonment and surrenders its interest in the subject-matter to the insurer. The insured can claim damage for total loss.

# What is Partial Loss:

When the subject-matter is partially damaged, it will be a case of partial loss. It is of two types:

1. **Particular Average Loss:**

A particular average loss has been defined as, `a partial loss of subject-matter insured, caused by a peril insured against, and which is not general average loss.` A particular average loss is `not caused voluntarily`. The insured subject-matter should be damaged and this damage should be caused by marine peril which is insured. 


2. **General Average Loss:**

A general average loss is `caused voluntarily` to avoid an impending danger. “A general average loss is one which is caused by an extra-ordinary sacrifice or expenditure voluntarily and reasonably made or incurred under fortuitous circumstances, for the sole purpose of preserving the common interest from an impending peril.”

If a ship is sinking because of overload, some of the cargo may be thrown out of the ship with a purpose to save the ship and the crew. It will be a case of general average loss.

# What is Hull Loss:

A hull loss is an aviation accident that damages the aircraft beyond economical repair,[2] resulting in a total loss. The term also applies to situations in which the aircraft are missing, the search for their wreckage is terminated or when the wreckage is completely inaccessible.

**Constructive hull loss** factors other incidental expenses beyond repair, such as salvage, logistical costs of repairing the non-airworthy aircraft within the confines of the incident site, recertifying the aircraft, etc. Insurance policies covering any asset that is subject to depreciation, typically pay the insured a fraction of the cost of replacing the property, so that a loss may be deemed to be total although some residual value remains.

# What is Liability?

When a person or organisation is `responsible` for something, especially in law, that’s liability. Liability insurance can cover you for legal costs and compensation costs that you might have to pay if you are proved to be the cause of harm to another person or business. Does not mean your ability to lie about, though that could lead to liability.



# What is Liability Insurance?

> Liability insurance protects you against `financial loss` if your actions, your negligence or the condition of your property is found to cause a person to be injured or killed, or a person's property to be damaged or destroyed or they suffer loss as a result of relying on your services or advice.

Liability insurance (also called third-party insurance) is a part of the general insurance system of `risk financing` to protect the purchaser (the "insured") from the risks of liabilities imposed by lawsuits and similar claims and protects the insured if the purchaser is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy.

Originally, individual companies that faced a common peril formed a group and created a self-help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss (in other words, a mutual insurance arrangement). The modern system relies on dedicated carriers, usually for-profit, to offer protection against specified perils in consideration of a premium.

Liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third-party insurance claims, i.e., payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. In general, damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. When a claim is made,[1] the insurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured. 

Liability products are most commonly taken out by businesses for risks involved in their day-to-day operation, but they are also built into many property insurance policies, for example liability cover in home and contents insurance.

Liability insurance covers two key financial risks. One is the legal cost of defending a claim. The second is the compensation that you may be directed to pay the injured or wronged party, plus their legal costs, if a claim against you is upheld.

These usually include an excess to be paid by the policyholder in the event of a claim, and generally set a limit on the total amount payable under the policy, as well as a per-claim limit.

# What Is Loss Development?

Loss development is the difference between the final losses recorded by an insurer and what the insurer originally recorded. Loss development seeks to account for the fact that some insurance claims take a long time to settle, and that estimates of the total loss that an insurer will experience will adjust as claims are finalized.

# What is Mortality Rate?

Mortality rate, or death rate, is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per $1,000$ individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of $9.5$ (out of $1,000$) in a population of $1,000$ would mean $9.5$ deaths per year in that entire population, or $0.95$% out of the total. It is distinct from `morbidity`, which is either the **prevalence or incidence of a disease**, and also from the incidence rate (the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time).

In the generic form, mortality rates are calculated as:

$$\frac{d}{p} * 10^n$$

where $d$ represents the deaths occurring within a given time period, $p$ represents the size of the population in which the deaths occur and $10^n$ is a conversion factor from fraction to some other unit (such as multiplying by $10^3$ to get mortality rate per 1,000 individuals).

# What Is the Frequency-Severity Method?

Frequency-severity method is an actuarial method for determining the 

- **Frequency:** Expected number of claims that an insurer will receive during a given time period
- **Severity:** How much the average claim will cost. 
  
Frequency-severity method uses historical data to estimate the `average number of claims` and the `average cost of each claim`. 

The method multiplies the average number of claims by the average cost of a claim.

## Frequency-Severity Method Explained

In the frequency-severity method, frequency refers to the number of claims that an insurer anticipates will occur over a given period of time. If the frequency is high, it means that a large number of claims is expected to occur. Severity refers to the cost of a claim. A high-severity claim is more expensive than an average claim, and a low-severity claim is less expensive than the average claim. Average costs of claims are estimated based on historical data. 

For instance, consider a prospective home buyer considering the purchase of a beach house in Miami. This part of the Florida coast averages one hurricane per year. With the potential for complete destruction so high and so frequent, the frequency-severity method would indicate that an insurance company should avoid underwriting a policy for this beach house.
