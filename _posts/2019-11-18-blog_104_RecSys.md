## How to build Recommendation System:

There are basically three types of recommender systems:-

**Demographic Filtering** - They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.



**Content Based Filtering** - They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

For example, for designing a Movie Recommendation system, using `Content based Filtering`, the movie description can be used as a notion of content. Now for K movies, let's say we have their description.

- Convert the description into TF-IDF vector of dimension D, i.e we will have a matrix of M of size `K x D`
- If we take dot product of M.dot(M.transpose), this will give a `K x K` matrix, where each row denotes the similarity score of the movie indexed at that row with all the other movies indexed at the columns of that row. 
- Pick `top N` movies from that rows ranking based on their similarity

**Collaborative Filtering** - This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.

## How to evaluate recommender system ?

Precision and Recall are useful for set based result.

But for rank based result we measure `Precision@K` and `Recall@K` and their formulas are different.


The two most popular ranking metrics are MAP and NDCG

- MAP: Mean Average Precision
- NDCG: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

The main difference between the two is that MAP assumes binary relevance (an item is either of interest or not), while NDCG allows relevance scores in form of real numbers. The relation is just like with classification and regression.
