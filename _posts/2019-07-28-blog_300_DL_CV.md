## Linear Classification

- **Q:** With N examples, how fast are training and prediction?
  - **Ans:** 
    - Train O(1),     
    - Predict O(N)
    - This is bad: we want classifiers that are fastat prediction; slow for training is ok

- Suppose that we found a $W$ such that $L = 0$. Is this $W$ unique?
  - NO. $2W$ also has $L = 0$

**Why regularize?**

- Express preferences over weights
- Make the model simple so it works on test data
- Improve optimization by adding curvature

- Q1: What is the `min/max` possible loss $L_i$?
  - A: min $0$, max $\infin$

- Q2: At initialization all s (score) will be approximately equal; what is the loss?
  - A: $\log(numberOfClass)$, e.g $\log(10)$ â‰ˆ $2.3$

## Siamese Network

Siamese networks are a special type of neural network architecture. Instead of a model learning to classify its inputs, the neural networks learns to differentiate between two inputs. It learns the similarity between them.
